                            <p>Please note that you are required to visit any Hospital of your preference, when advised by the doctor through the Matibabu telemedicine system.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We provide qualified healthcare professionals for the Matibabu consultation.</li>
                                <li>If the advice provided by the doctor through the Matibabu telemedicine is substantially different from your current treatment and prescribed medication, it is your duty to inform the doctor on the Matibabu consultation before implementing the management.</li>
                                <li>The health information, vital sign readings, dates, timings and notes logged in by you or on your behalf should be accurate.</li>
                                <li>As a patient of the Matibabu consultation, you are required to inform the doctor of all current and previous illnesses, health conditions, surgeries, consultations and medications with any other healthcare providers.</li>
                                <li>For self-monitored readings, it is the patient’s responsibility to use devices of proper quality and to ensure that they are re-calibrated when required.</li>
                                <li>Not following the instructions of the doctors will be considered as non-compliance of the agreement and the agreement will be terminated.</li>
                                <li>The healthcare team will provide advice based on the vitals provided by you. You are thus advised to provide these vitals accurately.</li>
                                <li>MaishaKenya, will not assume any legal responsibility for the patient’s medical condition and this Matibabu telemedicine consultation only intends to aid in understanding the condition better based on the information given and is not meant to replace an in-person consultation.</li>
                                <li>The online system is expected to enhance, not replace clinic visits. It is your responsibility to schedule follow-up appointments as indicated by your doctor.</li>
                                <li>The patient is free to discontinue using this service at any time, with the knowledge of MaishaKenya.</li>
                                <li>MaishaKenya can attend to Emergencies through this application. Under these circumstances, the client has the will to contact the nearest hospital or our Ambulance services immediately. </li>
                                <li>The client data will be kept confidential by MaishaKenya and will not be disclosed to anyone under normal circumstances except as requested by law or in an emergency situation when requested by another healthcare provider.</li>

                            <h4>2. Video Consultations</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>MaishaKenya Appointment Timing: While the client may specify the preferred appointment timing for a telemedicine consultation, MaishaKenya reserves the right to schedule the appointment for an alternative timing. If this timing is not convenient, the client can request that it be rescheduled or their payments refunded. Due to unpredictable and unforeseeable circumstances, the healthcare provider is sometimes unable to attend to the video consultation exactly at the appointed time. In such cases the session might be rescheduled to a later time in consultation with the client.    </li>
                                <li>Telemedicine Duration: By default, the average duration of a telemedicine consultation will be the duration decided by MaishaKenya. It reserves the right to decide when the consultation ends. If MaishaKenya, has to terminate the telemedicine consultation mid-way due to unavoidable circumstances, then a new session at an alternative timing will be scheduled.</li>
                                <li>Telemedicine Quality: The quality of the telemedicine session depends on the quality of the Internet connection, web cam and audio facilities of both the client and MaishaKenya. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that the performance and quality of the equipment and connection used, are optimal for doing the telemedicine session online.</li>
                                <li>Video Session Privacy, Security &amp; Etiquette: It is required that the client prepares ahead of time to participate in the Video Consultation, in a quiet and private place, where only the client is present in the room where the video session is being held. For elderly or disabled patients who require help to participate in the video, a caregiver may be present. There must be no audio/video recording of the video session by the client. It is necessary that the client (and any caregiver) act with proper decorum in speech and action during the video consultation. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in termination of the video session with no refund or rescheduling of the consultation.</li>
                                <li>Nature of Consultation: Video Consultations must not be scheduled for clients with critical medical conditions and/or for emergencies. Such consultations are suitable only for basic follow-ups between the client and healthcare provider.</li>
                            </ul>
